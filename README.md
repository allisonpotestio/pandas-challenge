# pandas-challenge
module 4 challenge


In this challenge, we merge student data with school demographic data in order to evaluate school performance. Using panda functions, we are able to manipulate the data to determine trends on the school level, comparing school size, school type and school budget. Overall, this was a successful exercise in determining some trends and identifying areas that need further analysis.
