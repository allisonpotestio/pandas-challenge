# pandas-challenge
module 4 challenge


In this challenge, we merge student data with school demographic data in order to evaluate school performance. Using panda functions, we are able to manipulate the data to determine trends on the school level, comparing school size, school type and school budget. Overall, this was a successful exercise in determining some trends and identifying areas that need further analysis. 


The code is the same in both the .txt file and .ipynb file-- a classmate said she got a zero for submitting .pynb only. I am not sure if she is working on the same challenge, but I want to be safe. Thank you!
